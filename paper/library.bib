	abstract = {An analysis of a data set consisting of 3 years of high time resolution radioxenon stack measurements from the three nuclear reactors at the Forsmark nuclear power plant in Sweden, as well as measurements of atmospheric radioxenon in Stockholm air, 110 km away, is presented. The main causes for the stack releases, such as the function of the xenon mitigation systems, presence of leaking fuel elements, and reactor operations such as shutdown and startup, are discussed in relation to the stack data. The relation between radioxenon releases and reactor operation is clearly illustrated by the correlation between the stack measurements and thermal reactor power. In general, the isotopic ratios of the Stockholm measurements, which are shown to mainly originate from Forsmark releases, agree well with stack measurements, and with a modeled reactor operational sequence. Results from a forward atmospheric dispersion calculation agree very well with observed plume arrival times and widths, and with some exceptions, also with absolute activity concentrations. The results illustrates the importance of detailed knowledge of radioxenon emissions from nuclear power plants when interpreting radioxenon measurements for nuclear test ban verification, and provide new input to this kind of analysis. Furthermore, it demonstrates the possibility to use sensitive radioxenon detection systems to remotely detect and verify reactor operation.},

	abstract = {Knowledge on the global radioxenon background is imperative for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification. In this paper, the capability to simulate the radioxenon background from regional sources is assessed at two International Monitoring System stations in Europe. An ensemble dispersion modeling approach is used to quantify uncertainty by making use of a subset of the Ensemble Prediction System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Although the uncertainty quantification shows promising results, the ensemble shows a lack of spread that could be attributed to emission uncertainty from nuclear power plants, which is not taken into account. More knowledge on the emissions of nuclear power plants can help improve our understanding of the radioxenon background.},

abstract = {Shapelets are discriminative sub-sequences of time series that best predict the target variable. For this reason, shapelet discovery has recently attracted considerable interest within the time-series research community. Currently shapelets are found by evaluating the prediction qualities of numerous candidates extracted from the series segments. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, this paper proposes a novel perspective in terms of learning shapelets. A new mathematical formalization of the task via a classification objective function is proposed and a tailored stochastic gradient learning algorithm is applied. The proposed method enables learning near-to-optimal shapelets directly without the need to try out lots of candidates. Furthermore, our method can learn true top-K shapelets by capturing their interaction. Extensive experimentation demonstrates statistically significant improvement in terms of wins and ranks against 13 baselines over 28 time-series datasets.},

abstract="Shapelet models have attracted a lot of attention from researchers in the time series community, due in particular to its good classification performance. However, such models only inform about the presence/absence of local temporal patterns. Structural information about the localization of these patterns is ignored. In addition, end-to-end learning shapelet models tend to generate meaningless shapelets, leading to poorly interpretable models. In this paper, we aim at designing an interpretable shapelet model that takes into account the localization of the shapelets in the time series. Time series are transformed into feature vectors composed of both a distance and a localization information. Then, we design a hierarchical feature selection process using regularization. This process can be tuned to select, for each shapelet, either only its distance information or both distance and localization information. It is hence possible for every selected shapelet to analyze whether only the presence or the presence and the localization contributed to the decision process improving interpretability of the decision. Experiments show that this feature selection process has competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art shapelet-based classifiers, while providing better interpretability.",

A general yet structuring methodological strategy is adopted to organize this vast body of work. More precisely, detection algorithms considered in this review are characterized by three elements: a cost function, a search method and a constraint on the number of changes. Each of those elements is described, reviewed and discussed separately. Implementations of the main algorithms described in this article are provided within a Python package called ruptures.}

abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.}
